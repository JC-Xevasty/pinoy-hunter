**Pinoy Hunter: The Maligno Chronicles** is an interactive text-based adventure game.   

The game was made using Python purely with text and characters. With the lack of image,  
animation, and GUI, the game uses a narrative story-telling and an option-based style  
instead of buttons for the user to use. It relies heavily on the user's imagination and  
decision-making skills.

The game was inspired by different films and games such as **Pok√©mon** and **Tiktik: The  
Aswang Chronicles**. It is mainly based on a Philippine cultural setting. It showcases  
monsters and creatures based from Philippine mythology.

**Pinoy Hunter: The Maligno Chronicles** is set in a barrio in the Siquijor province. It is  
about how Juan dela Cruz and her wife Maria faces problems during their honeymoon in  
a strange place. The user will control Juan throughout the adventure.Each decision and  
action will affect the characters and determine how the story will play out.
